0.6d
 - FEF-3 support. Not all controls are in the HUD simply because there
   is too many of them, but all that are used during normal startup,
   firing and driving are.
 - Separate Blowers for J94
 - Experimental green speed indicator when speed is up to 5 units
   (mph/kph) below the speed limit.

0.6
 - WARNING: some of my internal configurations have changed a little.
   If you rely on them have a look in the locoss sections.
 - Made an optiom for the program to treat driving backwards as forwards
   (Shift-Alt-S). Very usefull for some locos/scenarios where you have to
   drive backwards for longer periods of time.
 - New axes for the joystick: Small Ejector, HandBrake, Blower, Damper.
   Very usefull for 3rd party realistic locos (e.g. VictoryWorks).
 - Big optimization in the LUA overlay code. Don't check for existance
   of ControlValues per iteration. Check this info only once on loco
   initialization.
 - Inclusion of DataExtractor. New version, integrated in the main
   package. Thanks CobraOne.
 - Separate units detection for brakes. Now a loco displays properly
   BAR/PSI if it has brakes that use both.
 - SteamHeating indicator.
 - Detections and notches configurations for more locos I bought recently.
 - Cleanups in my own configs, they wont take precedence over axes set
   explicitly. ReplaceControls() function for this. They are grouped
   under "Havner's config" comments.

0.5
 - WARNING: keyboard shortcuts got changed again due to steamers addition
 - Support for steamers, see the readme
 - Detection script will notify what loco has been detected
 - Detections and notches configurations for MANY more locos (ALL I own)
 - Handbrake indicator, better CruiseControl/AFB indicator
 - CruiseControl axis for locos other then German AFB
 - Separate Loco and Train brakes indicators (some locos use both)

0.4
 - WARNING: the keyboard shortcuts (F1-F9) got changed again due
   to the addition of Distance and a change with TargetSpeed
 - WARNING: the modifier for ALL the shortcuts got changed to
   SHIFT-ALT due to collisions with TS shortcuts (adv. brakes)
 - Distance/Countdown implementation, see the readme
 - Moved the TargetSpeed to the controls (blue) section
 - Made it possible to use the Patcher without TS registry entries
   and custom named RailWorks folder
 - Handle the windowed mode case, move together with TS window
 - Removed numbers formatting in lua for some variables, pass the full float/double
 - Detections and notches configurations for more locos
 - Minor code changes

0.3
 - WARNING: the script has been split into 3 files, you need all
  - Overlay configuration is in the trainsim-helper-overlay.lua
  - Joystick configuration is in the trainsim-helper-joystick.lua
  - Detections for locos are in the trainsim-helper.lua
 - WARNING: ALL ControlRanges are detected before Locos detections
  - This allows for less code in the detection routines
 - GearControl axis added (Gear Lever)
 - Gear in the Overlay moved to the controls group (blue)
  - WARNING: Because of this shortcuts got shifted by 1 (F1-F9, F11-F12)
 - Vacuum Pipe added to the Overlay (red), Vacuum Chamber ignored (seems irrelevant)
 - Moved the clock to align better with long scenario names and F5 UI
 - Overlay GradientUK format option (1:XXX) (mostly autodetected for UK)
 - Fixed gigantic speed limits for SpeedLimitType == 3 (now it's '??')
 - Add units to acceleration, recalculate from m/s^2 (Kph/m, Mph/m)
 - Moved most of the calculations to C++ for performance and greater control
 - Readme updated (TOC and section on how to receive help)
 - Detections and notches configurations for more locos
 - Source code from now is on github:
  - https://github.com/Havner/trainsim-helper

0.2a
 - Added M8Brake to the list of controllable TrainBrakes
 - Fix for the patcher to handle very old locos that don't provide Initialise()
 - Fix for the patcher in case there are already 2 scripts named the same but one .lua, one .out
 - Detections and notches configurations for more locos

0.2
 - Next speed limit + distance
 - Keyboard shortcuts for turning off the whole overlay or just parts of it
 - Command line switches to disable joystick support completely
 - Command line switches to turn off the overlay or just parts of it
 - Notched levers support (needs to be configured manually per loco)
 - An option to redefine warning strings
 - Patcher template updated to pass frame interval for future use
 - More examples in the code for the new functions
 - Internal code changes
 - Docs updated, changelog and todo added

0.1a
 - Changed the BRs in the readme to be readable in notepad
 - Fixed BAR/PSI display for some locos
 - Added Reverser control

0.1
 - initial release
