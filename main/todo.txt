Next version:
- Optimize overlay (don't check for existance on each iteration)
- VacuumBrakes (INCHES, Class 86)
- Check one loco with PSI/BAR settings (class 86)

For the future:
- Steamers support
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
