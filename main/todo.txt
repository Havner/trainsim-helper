Next version:
- Clean up the C++ code, split into classes
- Train Length
+ Side Change (Invert direction)
+ More configurations
+ Axes:
  + small ejector
  + handbrake
  + blower
  + damper
+ steam heating (gwr railmotor, 56xx, j94, castle, EU?)
+ 56xx keys and internals, missing control values
- J94 (loco/air brake)
- FEF-3 (all) for later
- data extractor:
  - source
	- new version
	- format output
	- integrate with TSH
	- fix bugs
+ SwitchControlFromTo() (only if not defined)
- separate units for brakes

For the future:
- Optimize overlay (don't check for controlvalues on each frame)
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
