- Fix units on BR86
- Add AWS/DSD sound alerter
- Train Length
- Notches names with showing actual lever value instead of internals?
- Clean up the C++ code
  - split into classes
  - more generalization in the C++ code
  - general cleanups
- Clean up the LUA code:
  - PZB warning for RSC German locos
- Alternative script for locos with broken scripts

- tsh-detect-locos.lua
- tsh-detect-values.lua
- use detect values for overlay
- tsh-functions.lua
- UINT_MAX for VSoll in BR189?

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
