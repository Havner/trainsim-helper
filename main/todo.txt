For the future:
- Optimize overlay (don't check for controlvalues on each frame)
- Steamers support
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
