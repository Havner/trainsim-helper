Next version:
- Clean up the C++ code, split into classes
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit
- Train Length

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
