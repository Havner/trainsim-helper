- Remove the "*:" from Call()
- Add AWS/DSD sound alerter
- Clean up the C++ code, split into classes
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit
- Train Length
- Notches names with showing actual lever value instead of internals?
- Cleaning up LUA:
  - lever values?
  - ordering of locos
  - PZB warning for RSC German locos
  - removing Havner's reverser config?
  - Generic detections? elseif->if, remove things that go there anyway
- MeshTools x3

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
