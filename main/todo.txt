- Remove the "*:" from all Call() is it makes sense
- Add AWS/DSD sound alerter
- Train Length
- Notches names with showing actual lever value instead of internals?
- Clean up the C++ code
  - split into classes
  - more generalization in the C++ code
  - general cleanups
- Clean up the LUA code:
  - lever values?
  - ordering of locos
  - PZB warning for RSC German locos
  - removing Havner's reverser config?
  - Generic detections? elseif->if, remove things that go there anyway
- Alternative script for locos with broken scripts
- Think of displaying real, not underlaying values for throttles on non steamers
  (put Find* functions to main script, use them in overlay)

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
