Next version:
- Clean up the C++ code, split into classes
- More generalization in the C++ code and cleaning it a bit
- Train Length
+ Side Change (Invert direction)
+ More configurations
+ Axes:
  + small ejector
  + handbrake
  + blower
  + damper
+ steam heating (gwr railmotor, 56xx, j94, castle, EU?)
+ 56xx keys and internals, missing control values
+ J94 (loco/air brake)
- FEF-3 (all) for later
- data extractor:
  + source
  + new version
  + integrate with TSH
  + fix bugs
+ ReplaceControls() (only if not defined)
+ separate units for brakes
- Optimize overlay (don't check for controlvalues on each frame)
+ LocoBrake axis? class37 reverser? change steams ejector?
- docs for data extractor
- docs for invert side
- docs for axes
- docs for train length
- docs for new axes

Things to consider for the very distant future:
- Make the overlay display values in the data file it doesn't know about
- Launch together with the game
- Second monitor window
- Configurator for the overlay (what to display, positions, colors)
